    <h1>How To Recover Your Lost Progress (Scopely Account)</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> 629 days ago</p>
    <p>Greetings Commander,</p>
    <p>Should you ever log in and notice that your account progress has been reset, please follow the steps below to restore access:</p>
    <h2>What happened to your game save</h2>
    <p>We never "Delete" nor "Erase" your progress. What can happen is that our system may fail to load your account from our database, so the game system generates a new user account. This can be caused by any of the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Logging into the game when you are NOT logged into your Scopely Account</li>
        <li>Logging into the game when you log in with a NEW Scopely Account</li>
        <li>Installing the game on a new device</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>To regain access</h2>
    <p>Please verify that you are correctly logged into your Scopely Account. If you are not logged in, simply:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Tap on your player profile and select settings</li>
        <li>Access the option “General” and scroll down to Scopely Account</li>
        <li>Select Log-in and enter the correct credentials (email and password)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>And you’ll be back in action!</p>
    <p>If that does not work, please contact support and we will manually restore access.</p>
    <p>Please provide us with:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your OLD username that you would like restored</li>
        <li>Your NEW username that the game system generated for your new account</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We'll get you fixed right up!</p>
    <p>Thanks,<br>Team Star Trek FC</p>
